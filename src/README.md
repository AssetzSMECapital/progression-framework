    Progression at Assetz
</h1>

This is a static site that displays the progression frameworks that Assetz use internally for our staff 🙌

It's built in Gatsby, and deployed using Netlify.

## 🚀 Quick start

You'll need the Gatsby CLI on your machine, so if you don't have it, install it!

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Next, navigate to the `progression-framework` directory and use yarn to get everything installed

```sh
cd progression-framework
npm install
```

If you're developing locally, you can start up the site locally with hot loading ⚡

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Finally, you can build everything into a set of static files 🛠️

```sh
gatsby build
```
